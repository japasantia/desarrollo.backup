	Function:
		String^	USB_CheckIfPresentAndGetCOMString(WORD USBVendorID, WORD USBProductID, DWORD deviceInstanceIndex, bool deviceIsComposite, BYTE compositeInterfaceIndex)

	Summary:
		This function checks if a USB CDC device is currently plugged in with 
		a matching USB VID and PID string.  If a matching device is found, it
		returns the COMx number string associated with the USB device.

	Description:
		This function checks if a USB CDC device is currently plugged in with 
		a matching USB VID and PID string.  If a matching device is found, it
		returns the COMx number string associated with the USB device.

	Precondition:
		None

	Parameters:
		WORD USBVendorID - The 16-bit Vendor ID (VID) of the USB device to try to find the COMx port number for
		WORD USBProductID - The 16-bit Product ID (PID) of the USB device to try to find the COMx port number for
		DWORD deviceInstanceIndex - The "instance index" of the USB device.  Always use '0', unless there are more than one instance of the hardware attached to the same computer simultaneously.
		bool deviceIsComposite - Use "true" if the CDC function is part of a composite USB device, otherwise use "false"
		BYTE compositeInterfaceIndex - The CDC interface index number, when the device is a composite USB device.  Value is irrelevant and may be '0' when deviceIsComposite is false.

	Return Values:
		String^ containing the "COMxx" string number (useful when trying to open the COM port).
				If no USB CDC COMx ports are currently provided by a USB with matching VID/PID,
				then the return value is: ""

	Remarks:
		This function is passive and does not attempt to open/close any COMx ports.  All it
		does is search for attached USB devices, that are currently providing COMx ports.
		
		This function is currently written to work only with a single instance of the USB device
		attached to the computer, with the given VID/PID.  If more than one device of matching
		VID/PID is simultaneously attached to the machine, then more than one COMx port number
		will exist (one for each CDC device).  This function will only return the first COMx
		number that it finds for the matching VID/PID.  If more than one exists, the additional
		COMx numbers will remain unknown.  To expand the functionality of this function, it would
		be possible to remove the "return COMString;" line of code, and instead keep looping
		until the "if(ErrorStatus == ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS)" exit condition is hit instead.
		In this case, the loop will find multiple COMx numbers and instances, and these
		could be stored and returned in an array of strings instead.

					//3. Another lower level entry specific to the next function implemented in the composite device (ex: CDC).

					//1. Find the top level parent device based on VID/PID/current attachment status, index, etc.

/****************************************************************************
	Function:
		static String^ ContainerIDGUIDToString(GUID* pGUIDToConvert)

	Summary:
		This function converts a "GUID" type into a String^, formatted like: "{4f1763bd-8195-11e4-935e-3c970e83569e}"

	Description:
		This function converts a "GUID" type (a 128-bit integer) into a text String^, formatted like: "{4f1763bd-8195-11e4-935e-3c970e83569e}"

	Precondition:
		None

	Parameters:
		GUID* pGUIDToConvert - a pointer to a GUID that needs converting into the String^ format.

	Return Values:
		String^ containing the string formatted version of the GUID value.

	Remarks:
		The returned string contains the extra characters like the "{" and "}" braces,
		as well as dashes separating number groups.  There are however different methods of
		representing GUIDs as strings (ex: different digit grouping/dash locations), so make
		sure this format ("{4f1763bd-8195-11e4-935e-3c970e83569e}") is what you actually want.
