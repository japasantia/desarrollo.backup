This program implements a basic example showing how to find and connect up to
multiple USB devices with the same USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID).
When there are multiple instances of a given hardware product attached to
the same computer simultanesouly, each device has an "instance" number associated
with it, and each instance also has a unique device path.  Each unique device
path can be used to open read/write handles to that specific USB device hardware
instance.

Keeping track of multiple instances of hardware is somewhat complicated however,
as all USB devices are intrinsically plug and play devices.  Therefore it is possible
for the USB device instance counts and instance indexes to change dynamically at 
runtime, if the user adds or removes additional hardware instances from their computer.
