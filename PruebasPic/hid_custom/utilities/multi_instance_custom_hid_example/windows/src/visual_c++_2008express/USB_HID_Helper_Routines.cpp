FUNCTION:	 DWORD HID_GetUSBDeviceCountAndOneDevicePath(WORD VendorID, WORD ProductID, BOOL deviceIsComposite, WORD compositeInterfaceIndex, GUID* pGUID, DWORD instanceIndexForPath, TCHAR* pDevicePath, DWORD* pPathBufferSize, DWORD actualBufferSize)

DESCRIPTION: Checks if any USB device(s) with matching VID/PID (and GUID, if specified, and composite interface index, if
the device is composite) are currently attached to the system.  The function returns the total number of matching devices found,
and (optionally) the device path of a specified device instance index.

PARAMETERS:
WORD VendorID - Caller supplied 16-bit unsigned integer value that is the USB VID number for the USB device to find

WORD ProductID - Caller supplied 16-bit unsigned integer value that is the USB PID number for the USB device to find

BOOL deviceIsComposite - Caller supplied boolean TRUE/FALSE indicating if the device interface to be searched for is part of
       a composite USB device.  Use TRUE if the WinUSB interface is part of a multi-interface composite USB 
	   device, or, use FALSE if the WinUSB interface is implemented on a non-composite USB device.

WORD compositeInterfaceIndex - Caller supplied index number for the WinUSB interface of interest, on the composite device.
       This parameter is only relevant if the deviceIsComposite value is specified as TRUE.  When deviceIsComposite is FALSE,
	   this parameter may be set to NULL.  When deviceIsComposite is TRUE, the compositeInterfaceIndex value specified 
	   must match the WinUSB interface index number specified in the USB device's configuration descriptor set
	   implemented in the device firmware.  Zero is a valid compositeInterfaceIndex.

GUID* pGUID - Optional caller supplied pointer to a GUID (globally unique identifier, which is a 128-bit number) for the
       device's WinUSB function.  The GUID for the WinUSB function may be customized and is specified in the driver package 
	   .inf file (and optionally, also in the device firmware's MS OS descriptor set).  This parameter is optional, and may be
	   set to NULL.  If the pGUID is NULL, this function will search for and return the total count of USB devices with
	   matching VID/PID (and composite index, if deviceIsComposite = TRUE), regardless of their actual WinUSB GUIDs.  If instead
	   a valid pointer to a real GUID (matching the value in the WinUSB driver package .inf and device firmware MS OS descriptors),
	   then this function only returns the count of devices matching all of the VID + PID + GUID simultaneously. 

DWORD instanceIndexForPath - Caller supplied device index number, to fetch the path information for.  A computer may have more than
       one USB device attached to the same machine simultaneously, with matching VID/PID (and optional GUID).  If so, each device
	   instance will have a separate/unique device path string associated with it.  The instanceIndexForPath value specifies
	   what device instance the path information should be returned for, in the optional pDevicePath buffer.

	   If you only ever intend to write a PC application that can connect to only one instance of the hardware at a time (even if more than one
	   instance are physically attached), it is okay to use the instanceIndexForPath value of 1 (ex: find/attach to the only the first
	   device found, even if there are more).

	   If one device is attached to the machine, it will be located at instanceIndexForPath 1.  If four devices are attached, they will 
	   be initially located at index 1, 2, 3, and 4.  If the PC application fetches
	   the path info and connects up to all four device simultaneously, but then the user unplugs the hardware associated with instance indexs
	   2 and 4, the connections to instances 1 and 3 will remain open and valid.  However, if USB_GetUSBDeviceCountAndOneDevicePath() is called,
	   the return value will only be 2.  In this scenario, the former instance 3 device becomes effectively renumbered as instance 2 (ex:
	   if you call USB_GetUSBDeviceCountAndOneDevicePath() and get the path for instance index 2, it should match the formerly fetched path for
	   the previous instance index 3).  Passing instanceIndexForPath of 0 will result in instanceIndexForPath of 1 being used instead, since 0 itself
	   is not a valid value.

	   If subsequently the user plugs in five more devices, these new devices will also cause a re-numbering of the former instance indexes,
	   and may "appear" at instance indexes lower, higher, or intermingled with the former instance indexes, such that the final valid instance
	   indexes will start and 1 and be contiguous up to the maximum number of simultaneous matching devices attached to the system.  Ex: If
	   USB_GetUSBDeviceCountAndOneDevicePath() returns 7, then the valid instance indexes (at that exact moment) will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

	   Although attaching new hardware devices (with matching VID/PID and optional GUID/composite interface index) will renumber the
	   indexes in unpredicatable ways, the paths of previously attached devices (that remain attached after the new devices are added)
	   should remain the same/unchanged.  Therefore, if a PC application will be connecting to multiple devices simultaneously, it is recommended
	   to save the paths for each instance index detected, and then after each plug and play event, check which device paths remain valid/unchanged,
	   which ones have disappeared (after looking at the paths of all current device instances), and which ones have newly appeared.  
	   
	   Presumably software should normally not attempt to parse the contents of path strings.  However path strings presumably contain 
	   embedded within them some information about what USB host controller number and USB host/hub port number that the USB device
	   is attached to.  Presumably, the path strings should be fairly static, so long as the location of the device doesn't change
	   (ex: due to the user unplugging the device and moving it to a different USB host/hub port number).

	   To uniquely and deterministically identify individual USB devices on a bus however, it is necessary for the device firmware
	   to implement a USB serial number descriptor, which must be different for every single instance of that hardware comming off the
	   production line.

Input/Output TCHAR* pDevicePath - Caller supplied pointer to a RAM buffer that has been allocated to receive the
       USB device path string, if the device is attached.  This parameter is optional, and
	   may be set = NULL, if you only want to detect if the device is present or not, or
	   are don't yet know how large of a buffer to allocate to hold the (variable length) 
	   device path string.

Input/Output DWORD* pPathBufferSize - Caller supplied pointer to a DWORD (32-bit unsigned int), which will get overwritten 
       with the required size (in number of bytes) for the pDevicePath buffer.  

Input DWORD actualBufferSize - The size of the caller's allocated buffer for receiving the path string, when pDevicePath is non-NULL.
       When pDevicePath is non-NULL, this function will only write up to the actualBufferSize number of bytes to the *pDevicePath.


	   
RETURN VALUE:
DWORD - 0 if no devices with matching VID/PID and GUID (if supplied) were found.  Otherwise, the return value is the number
of simultaneous device instances of hardware attached to the machine (with matching VID/PID and optionally GUID if supplied). 

If the function call succeeded, it should return ERROR_SUCCESS (upon checking the last value with GetLastError()).

If an internal error occurs (such as insufficient memory during malloc(), or an unexpected SetupAPI error), the return value
may be correct or may be less than the actual true number of devices attached to the system at that moment, and GetLastError()
should return something other than ERROR_SUCCESS.


REMARKS:
Since the device path string length is initially unknown (could vary by OS, host/hub port number, etc.), the caller should first
call this function with pDevicePath = NULL, but with a valid pPathBufferSize pointer.  Upon the first
call, if the function returns TRUE (indicating USB device detected), the pPathBufferSize destination DWORD
will get updated with the required RAM size for the pDevicePath buffer.  The caller should then use the
pPathBufferSize DWORD to malloc an equivalent sized RAM buffer, which can then be used on a second call
to this function, this time with a valid/non-NULL pDevicePath input.  This function will then return
the actual device path info (which can later be used by CreateFile() to open a handle to the device).

Alternatively, and for best performance, a pre-allocated buffer may be used, so long as the actualBufferSize is
correctly specified, to limit the returned data size to avoid buffer overflow.  It is possible in this case that
the actual path could be larger than the pre-allocated buffer, causing only a partial path to be returned.
If this occurs, the caller should re-size the buffer than call the function again to get the complete path information.

This function may be relatively slow executing (ex: milliseconds to return), with relatively high CPU utilization, as many 
of the SetupAPI function calls needed for finding the device are not especially fast.  Additionally, some of these 
Windows API functions (first implemented in the Windows 9x era) have known issues (such as returning illegal/improper 
results if you call the same functions back to back too quickly).  Therefore, for best performance and most reliable 
results, it is preferrable to pre-allocate a RAM buffer for retreiving the device path string, of at least 66000 bytes long,
prior to calling this function for the first time.  

According to the https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx
the max path length is ~32767 characters (but with unicode = 65534 bytes) + a few bytes of not fully specified/deterministic overhead. 
It is conceivable that this max path length could expand in some future hypothetical OS, so it is still recommended to verify
the pPathBufferSize value was < actualBufferSize, prior to assuming that the retreived path is valid (and if it is not, calling
USB_GetUSBDeviceCountAndOneDevicePath() again with a new larger buffer, to get the full path).

Additionally, due to the unexpected behavior upon calling some of the SetupAPI functions back to back too quickly, it is recommended
to wait at least 1-2ms or more between consecutive calls to USB_GetUSBDeviceCountAndOneDevicePath().  It is also recommended to
assume that this function is not thread safe, and that it should only be called from a single thread at a time.

	/* 
	Before we can "connect" our application to our USB embedded device, we must first find the device.
	A USB bus can have many devices simultaneously connected, so somehow we have to find our device, and only
	our device.  This is done with the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID).  Each USB product line should have
	a unique combination of VID and PID.  USB device interfaces also have Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) 
	associated with them.  The USB device interface will have a GUID associated with it, which for some types 
	of devices is pre-defined, while for other classes (such as the custom/vendor class using WinUSB), the GUID 
	can be user configured through the values in the .inf file (or sometimes USB descriptors).

	Microsoft has created a number of functions which are useful for finding plug and play devices.  Documentation
	for each function used can be found in the MSDN library.  We will be using the following functions:

	SetupDiGetClassDevs()					//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
	SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
	GetLastError()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows
	SetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoList()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
	SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
	SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
	malloc()								//part of C runtime library, msvcrt.dll?
	CreateFile()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows

	We will also be using the following unusual data types and structures.  Documentation can be found in
	the MSDN library:

	SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA
	SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA
	SP_DEVINFO_DATA
	HDEVINFO
	HANDLE
	GUID

	The ultimate objective of the following code is to:
	1.  Determine if any USB device(s) of matching VID/PID is attached to the machine.
	2.  If an instance is attached to the machine, get the device path string to the device.  The device path
	is needed when trying to call CreateFile() to get a handle to the device, which may in turn be used by
	separate device class specific API functions (such as WinUsb_Initialize() for vendor/custom class devices
	using the WinUSB driver), which can then be used to actually open the device for actual data transfers.

	Getting the device path is a multi-step round about process, which requires calling several of the 
	SetupDixxx() functions provided by setupapi.dll (which comes with/is a core part of Windows).

	//For composite devices, it is strongly preferrable to search for the device using the the WinUSB interface GUID from the .inf/MS 
	//OS descriptors in the firmware.  When you search for a composite WinUSB device using only the VID/PID and general purpose

	//at the parent device entry, is diffcult, particularly on OSes prior to Windows 7.  On Windows 7+, the composite device parent entry
	//in the registry will have a "Container ID" number, which can be cross referenced with other entries in the registry (that are also related

Function:
static String^ ContainerIDGUIDToString(GUID* pGUIDToConvert)

Summary:
This function converts a "GUID" type into a String^, formatted like: "{4f1763bd-8195-11e4-935e-3c970e83569e}"

Description:
This function converts a "GUID" type (a 128-bit integer) into a text String^, formatted like: "{4f1763bd-8195-11e4-935e-3c970e83569e}"

Precondition:
None

Parameters:
GUID* pGUIDToConvert - a pointer to a GUID that needs converting into the String^ format.

Return Values:
String^ containing the string formatted version of the GUID value.

Remarks:
The returned string contains the extra characters like the "{" and "}" braces,
as well as dashes separating number groups.  There are however different methods of
representing GUIDs as strings (ex: different digit grouping/dash locations), so make
sure this format ("{4f1763bd-8195-11e4-935e-3c970e83569e}") is what you actually want.
